# Vis a Vis Test

Test task for Vis a Vis companies.

## Run the project


To run the project first of all, you need to install all the necessary packages. To do this, you need to run the command "npm i".

###### Install all required packages:
```bash
npm i
```

You can then use the command "npm run dev" to run the project in development mode, or if you just need to preview the project, you can use the command "npm run build" to compile the build and "npm run start" to run the project.

###### Develop mode:
```bash
npm run dev
```
###### Viewing mode:
```bash
#First run the build
npm run build

#Once the project has been build, you can run it
npm run start
```
